  business_hours
    Set the business hours for this Business::Hours object. Takes a hash of
    the form :

    { 0 => { Name => 'Sunday', Start => 'HH::MM', End => 'HH::MM'},

        1 => { Name => 'Monday',
                Start => 'HH::MM',
                   End => 'HH::MM'},
        ....

        6 => { Name => 'Saturday',
                Start => 'HH::MM',
                   End => 'HH::MM'},
        };

        Start and end times are of the form HH:MM.  Valid times are
        from 00:00 to 23:59.  If your hours are from 9am to 6pm, use
        Start => '9:00', End => '18:00'.  A given day MUST have a start
        and end time OR may declare both Start and End to be undef, if
        there are no valid hours on that day.

  for_timespan
    Takes a paramhash with the following parameters

            Start => The start of the period in question in seconds since the epoch
            End => The end of the period in question in seconds since the epoch

    Returns a Set::IntSpan of business hours for this period of time.
