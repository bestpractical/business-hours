Revision history for Perl module Business::Hours

0.07 Fri Jul  8 11:44:39 EDT 2005
  * Unembed tests  
  * POD cleanup (and add pod tests)
  * no longer an exporter that exports nothing 
  * http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=13374:   
	in certain time zones (try Guam, for example), the epoch   
	is a business hour, which led to some tests being run with 
	start hours of 0, which caught a few places in the code that   
	were checking $hours->first when they should have been checking
	defined $hours->first (or actually $hours->empty)
